The Productions

DETAiLFILM tells original, moving stories for an international audience. Stories that touch people, win over audiences and convince juries. They have been told at festivals worldwide e.g. Berlinale, Locarno, Karlovy Vary, SXSW... and won awards like two Crystal Globes @ Karlovy Vary, the Golden Dove @ DokLeipzig, an audience award @ SXSW, Golden Oranges @ Antalya and the German female Oscar, the LOLA.

We work with the whole spectrum of talents - promising young guns to multi-award winning filmmakers like Karim Ainouz, Kutlug Ataman, Hans Petter Moland, Mia Hansen-Løve, Mohammad Rasoulof, Olivier Assayas and Stéphane Robelin.

In 2015 DETAiLFILM opened up Zentropa Hamburg, a joint venture with Danish powerhouse Zentropa. DETAiLFILM is a member of the European Producer's Club as well as the German and the European Film Academy.
